Trouble in Terrorist Town is a community based gamemode where the overall goal for the Innocents and Detectives is to figure out who the Traitors are and then eliminate them or survive until the end, while the goal for the Traitors is to eliminate all the Innocents and Detectives within the time limit. There are 3 types of roles, these are: Innocents, Traitors and Detectives.
##### <u style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: inherit; white-space: nowrap;">How to win</u>

*The round will end under one of three conditions. They are:*

All Innocents Eliminated | **Traitors Win**<br>
All Traitors Eliminated | **Innocents Win**<br>
Time runs out | **Innocents Win**

The ‘All Innocents Eliminated’ outcome is where there is at least one Traitor left and no Innocents/Detectives alive. The ‘All Traitors Eliminated’ outcome is when at least one Innocent/Detective is left and no Traitors are alive. The ‘Time runs out’ outcome is when there are still Traitors and Innocents left alive. 

##### <u style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: inherit; white-space: nowrap;color: #0fb500">Playing as an Innocent</u>

While playing TTT, you’ll be innocent most of the time, so it’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with the ins and outs of the role. The main objectives of the innocents is to assist the detective in finding the traitors, stay alive and not make themselves suspicious.

##### <u style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: inherit; white-space: nowrap;color: #346beb">Playing as a Detective</u>

As the Detective, your main goal is to identify and eliminate all Traitors. Detectives are equipped with unique tools to help them find who the Traitors are. This includes the taser (which is used to identify a player’s role) and the body scanner (identifies the killer of a body). There are also extra items that only the Detective can buy. Notably, heavy armour and the health station.

Detectives can use the process of elimination to identify Traitors. Once you reveal a player to be an ‘Innocent’ by scanning them with a taser, you can call the player ‘proven’ which will make the whole server aware that they are not a Traitor. If all players are proven and all dead bodies have been ID’d, you are allowed to KOS the last player alive.  

##### <u style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: inherit; white-space: nowrap;color: #b50024">Playing as a Traitor</u>

If you get selected as a Traitor, your main goal will be to eliminate all Innocents and Detectives before the time runs out. You will be able to purchase exclusive Traitor items to aid you in this task. Items such as missiles, trip mines and turrets can be bought to kill Innocents and Detectives. You can also talk in the Traitor chat via chat and voice! Hold down ‘R’ while speaking to only communicate with your Traitor buddies. 

To succeed as a Traitor, you will have to use a combination of stealth and deception. Blend in with the Innocents and build their trust. Be selective of your targets, you don’t want to be seen killing anyone and risk being revealed as a Traitor. If you’re not the stealthy type you can always go in guns blazing. Just be careful not to get caught!

##### <u style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: inherit; white-space: nowrap;">Karma</u>

Every player has a Karma value. Karma ranges from 150 (highest) to 75 (lowest and auto-banned from the server). It starts at 100, and goes up if you kill a Traitor as an Innocent/Detective, and down if you teamkill (e.g. kill a fellow Innocent while being Innocent). 

As previously stated, your Karma can go up and down depending on your actions throughout the course of a round. Here are the points that you can earn/lose for certain actions:
