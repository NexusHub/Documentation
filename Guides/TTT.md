*The round will end under one of three conditions. They are:*

All Innocents Eliminated | **Traitors Win**<br>
All Traitors Eliminated | **Innocents Win**<br>
Time runs out | **Innocents Win**

The ‘All Innocents Eliminated’ outcome is where there is at least one Traitor left and no Innocents/Detectives alive. The ‘All Traitors Eliminated’ outcome is when at least one Innocent/Detective is left and no Traitors are alive. The ‘Time runs out’ outcome is when there are still Traitors and Innocents left alive.

While playing TTT, you’ll be innocent most of the time, so it’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with the ins and outs of the role. The main objectives of the innocents is to assist the detective in finding the traitors, stay alive and not make themselves suspicious.

**In-game shop**

If you type “!menu” in chat during a round, a buy-menu will open where you can buy helpful items such as tasers, armour, health shot’s etc. these items can be bought for tokens that is earned during the map and reset when the map changes, so it is encouraged to spend them. These items will help reach the end goal of the role you have been assigned at the start of the round.

**Martydom** - Purchasing this item from the store will make a nade drop to the ground upon your death, injuring anyone within the blast radius.

**Crossbow** - This is a silent weapon that can only be purchased by traitors. Shooting someone with this weapon will cause a small amount of initial damage (not enough to kill a healthy player) and will then cause them to bleed out for an additional for an additional 65hp over a short time period.
