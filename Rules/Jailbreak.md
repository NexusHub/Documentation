Jailbreak is a gamemode in which involves prisoners (Terrorists) and guards (Counter-Terrorists). The guards aim is to kill any rebelling prisoners and order them to play games within the prison in order to get to a final prisoner. The prisoners aim is to either survive by listening to the guards orders or by rebelling and killing the remaining guards. The guards are ran by a warden who is automatically selected at the beginning of each round. They are to govern the prison and gives guards explicit orders which they must follow at all times.

1. ##Global Rules

	9. You cannot have any jailbreak related instructions in your name. (all T's, jump rope, freeze).
	10. The terms "Guards" and "Prisoners" will always refer to the corresponding teams, it cannot be changed, used in a trap, etc.. its an overriding name and should only be used for overriding confusing situations.
	11. If your microphone is bad do not use it, people might not understand what you‚Äôre saying particularly as warden and it will cause complications.
	12. Unless you are part of the staff you cannot do microphone checks.
	13. The first round is always a programmed free day. Guards cannot give any orders excluding orders to drop guns, move away froma guard they are getting too close too, etc.
	14. Orders must be given and doors must be opened before 9:00 otherwise the plugin will automatically grant a free-day. If orders have not been given the Guard that opened the doors will be guard banned.
	15. The plugins are made for a reason, if the plugin prints its a free day it's a free day. (few exceptions).
	16. Cell doors should only be opened when the warden gives the command to do so or does it themselves (unless a rebelling T gets them open first).

	19. Shots must not be fired into a stack of prisoners unless the guard is certain they have a clear shot or if the stack is rebelling.

	5. Wait until warden has finished completing the order.
	6. Prisoners must follow the orders given by the warden until 20 seconds after his death (restrictions still apply).
	7. When given an order you try to complete it with the given restrictions (Unless specified all minigames CLEAR all movement restrictions). Should the minigame require you to ignore certain restrictions, the restriction will be lifted for the period of doing the minigame, and will re-apply after (unless specified otherwise).
	8. When given an order which you cannot complete (not including restrictions) you have to freeze
	9. You have to actively participate in (map) mini-games (so you can't be just frozen and waiting).

	11. You're not allowed to use the !lr menu if you are the last prisoner alive and still in the process of completing a minigame or order.

	10. Guards should leave the armoury by 9:30 and can only return to the armoury if a prisoner is seen in the armoury or for a very prompt ammo restock.

	5. No glitching an LR so that one of the parties is stuck or is unable to take part fairly in and LR. This involves teleporting players to unfair places where if they win they may die or telling a guard to go to a place which puts you at an unfair advantage. This also mean's for special days such as war days, you cannot hold down a location which gives you a distinct advantage over the other team i.e. jb_clouds - Extreme climb teleporter or other map teleports
	6. Last Requests that require staff must be accepted by 3 parties: the player itself, the warden and a staff member (missing 1 of the 3 implies you don't get your LR)

	10. Players cannot slay themselves or kill themselves if they do not like an LR game.
	11. Prisoners can still be classed as rebelling when they have access to LR. Being last alive is not a free pass to intimidate guards.
	12. Teaming is not allowed in special days except Hunger Games.
7. ##Useful Definitions
	1. Hunting: Actively looking for rebels away from the Warden.
	2. Freekill: If a guard kills a prisoner who was not rebelling.
	3. Rebelling: Rebelling is when a prisoner turns breaks any prisoner rules or whenever a prisoner is not following order given by the warden.
	4. Walking: Either shift/crouch walking (no jumping).
	5. Shift: Whatever button you press to walk which is not crouching.
	6. Baiting: Coming within knifing distance of a prisoner or standing within the path of a moving transit of prisoners. If a prisoner knifes you from you baiting, you cannot retaliate.
	7. Ghosting: Ghosting is an act of multiple players handing out information to each other which result in an unfair gaming experience.
	8. Free time: An area restricted "free-day" where prisoners can freely move in (including jumping) and must follow the given restrictions for this free-time. (you cannot leave the area, you do not need to listen to any commands until free-time is revoked).
	9. Stairs / Ramp: Is the same thing.
	10. Bloodhound: The last prisoner trying to find the rebels for the guards to kill. There is no baiting during bloodhound and the guards may kill the bloodhound if they are purposely delaying.

	14. AFK Freeze: not touching your keyboard or mouse and your character is standing still (not emoting or freelooking)
8. ##Special Days
	1. Bhop Battle - You have to use knife kill everyone, with bunny hop enabled.
	2. Knife Battle - You have to use a knife to kill everyone. You have 3 lifes.
	3. Kill confirmed - Kill someone and a chicken will drop, pick it up and they will be unable to respawn, just like the COD gamemode ‚ÄòKill Confirmed‚Äô.
	4. Gang war - Two teams, crips and bloods, you have to try kill each other and if the team gets to one sided then it equalises the teams.
	5. No scope - You have a awp and cant use your scope and then have a no scope battle.
	6. Scoutzknivez - Low gravity scouts battle in a Free-For-All.
	7. One in a chamber - You have a deagle and only 1 bullet kill people and you will get your bullet back.
	8. Head shot - Head shot only 1v1 Deagle.
	9. Shark - Guards are in noclip and prisoners have a awp and guards have to kill prisoners with their knife.
	10. Nightcrawler - Have a laser that is green and CT‚Äôs are invisible and if a CT is in front of a t their laser goes red.
	11. Trigger discipline - You have a usp and if you miss a shot you lose hp.
	12. Gun game - All start with a gun and have to get 2 kills with that gun to upgrade it just like the COD game mode.
	13. Hunger Games - All players spawn in a circle surrounding a crate. You must go out and break crates to get weapons from them.
	14. War - Prisoners are Blinded, and guards (with increased Hp and speed) must all go to one area and wait for prisoners, who are given Ak-47s to be unblinded and then attempt to find and kill them.
	15. Special day vote - Vote for a special day
	16. Hide and seek day - Custom special day that can be chosen by a prisoner if a Mod agrees. Prisoners will hide in spots across the map, whilst the Guards wait in armory until the clock has ticked down to 7:30. The members on the Guard team (CT side) will be healed to a high HP level so that they cannot be killed by prisoners whilst seeking.
	17. As Hide and Seek is a custom LR and has not been implimented into the jailbreak plugins there is a few rules you must follow when taking part:
		1. The prisoner that is choosing the special day at the end of the round MUST ask a staff member if they are allowed to do a Hide and Seek day. This is due to the fact that staff members are the only ones with perms to heal the Guard team so that they cannot be killed. If a staff member is not online at that given time Hide and Seek will not be able to be chosen as a special day.
		2. Use of the federal arsenal by the guard team is not permitted as it may create an unfair advantage for the seekers. (E.g The UAV which can be purchased from the federal arsenal will show the location of all members on the enemy team on the minimap, Which when used by a seeker (Member of the guard team) will destroy the point of the special day and ruin the fun of the round for all participants.)
		3. Snitching by a member of the hiding team is not allowed. This will ruin the round for other members of the hiding team as their position has just been given away. People who break this rule will be punished accordingly.
